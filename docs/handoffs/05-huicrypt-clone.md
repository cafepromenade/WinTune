# Handoff: WinTune Vault (HuiCrypt / VeraCrypt-derived disk encryption)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Local fork: `C:\Users\cntow\Documents\GitHub\HuiCrypt` (VeraCrypt → TrueCrypt 7.1a derived, C/C++) |
| **License** | Apache License 2.0 (VeraCrypt portions) + TrueCrypt License 3.0 (legacy parts). Source-available; **derived works must NOT use the "TrueCrypt" / "VeraCrypt" names or logos** — de-brand mandatory. |
| **Proposed module** | "WinTune Vault" (粵語: WinTune 保險庫) · left-nav group **Security & Privacy** · Tag `module.vault-volumes` |
| **Effort** | **L** — no native crypto to write, but a rich create/mount/dismount front-end over a CLI, plus elevation, progress parsing and bundling the de-branded binary. |

## What the user asked for
Bring HuiCrypt (a VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt fork) into WinTune as a disk-encryption module: create encrypted volumes/containers, mount/dismount, change password, and benchmark — with a polished bilingual WinUI front-end, bundling the HuiCrypt-built binary and stripping all "Hui"/"VeraCrypt"/"TrueCrypt" branding to "WinTune Vault".

## Recommended approach
**Hybrid (wrap the CLI + rich WinUI front-end).** Per the global strategy, a native C# reimplementation is the goal *only* when feasible — here it is not. The codebase is large C/C++ implementing on-the-fly encryption with a **kernel-mode filesystem/disk driver** (`veracrypt.sys`). Reimplementing the cryptography, volume format, and driver in C# would be infeasible and dangerously insecure. So we wrap the binary's command-line interface and build the GUI around it.

Realistic v1: a WinUI page that drives a **de-branded** `VeraCrypt.exe` / `VeraCrypt Format.exe` (renamed, e.g. `WinTuneVault.exe`) via its documented switches for mount, dismount, and silent operations, plus a guided "Create container" wizard. **Note:** `Catalog/VaultTweaks.cs` already ships ~20 VeraCrypt ops (`vault.veracrypt.*`) that shell out to `%ProgramFiles%\VeraCrypt\...`. **Extend that, do not duplicate** — the new module should host a real UI flow; keep the catalog ops as quick-actions but repoint paths to the bundled de-branded binary.

## Features to implement (v1 → later)
- **v1:** Create encrypted file container (size, filesystem, AES/Serpent/Twofish, password, optional keyfile/PIM) via `Format.exe`; mount to a chosen drive letter (`/v /l /p /pim /k /q`); dismount one / dismount-all / force-dismount (`/d /f`); change volume password; list mounted volumes; run algorithm benchmark; open a mounted volume in Explorer.
- **later:** Hidden volumes, full-partition/system encryption, favourites & auto-mount, keyfile generator, traveler-disk, volume header backup/restore, read-only / removable-media mount options.

## Integration plan (WinTune specifics)
- **New files:** `Services/VaultVolumeService.cs` (build CLI arg strings, call `ShellRunner.Run` with `elevated:true` where needed, parse mount list), `Pages/VaultVolumesModule.xaml` + `.cs` (wizard + mounted-volumes list). Extend existing `Catalog/VaultTweaks.cs` rather than adding a new catalog file.
- **Nav wiring:** add `NavigationViewItem Tag="module.vault-volumes"` in `MainWindow.xaml` (Security & Privacy group); add a `ModuleRegistry` entry (`Services/ModuleRegistry.cs`) for master search; wire the Tag in `MainWindow.xaml.cs` `MapType`, `NavView_SelectionChanged`, and `ApplyStartPage` (`--page vault-volumes`).
- **Engine/install:** winget id `n/a` (HuiCrypt is a custom fork — not in winget). Bundle the de-branded binary in the package and detect it; use `EngineBars.AutoInstallButton` only as a fallback pointing at upstream `VeraCrypt.VeraCrypt` if the bundled binary is missing. Show an InfoBar when the binary/driver is absent.
- **Pickers:** ALWAYS use `Services/FileDialogs.cs` (Win32 COM) for container path / keyfile / target folder — never WinRT pickers (module runs elevated).
- **Key CLIs to call:** `WinTuneVault.exe /v <file> /l <letter> /p <pwd> /pim <n> /k <keyfile> /q /silent`; dismount `/d [letter] /f`; format wizard `WinTuneVault Format.exe`; benchmark/settings via the GUI exe.

## Dependencies & risks
- Mount/dismount and the kernel driver require **elevation** — route through `ShellRunner.Run(..., elevated:true)`; captured output is unavailable under UAC, so confirm state by re-listing drives.
- The `.sys` driver must be **signed** and installed; an unsigned re-branded build may be blocked by Windows. Driver signing is a hard prerequisite — flag early.
- **Never pass plaintext passwords on the command line in shipping builds** (visible to other processes); prefer stdin/interactive prompt where the binary supports it.
- Branding removal is a license obligation: rename exe/driver/strings and the bundled User Guide; do not surface "VeraCrypt"/"TrueCrypt" in any user-facing string.
- Volume operations are destructive (format overwrites the target) — gate with `destructive:true` confirmations like existing catalog ops.

## Acceptance criteria
- Builds clean (Debug + Release **x64**); "WinTune Vault" appears in the Security & Privacy nav group; create → mount → browse → dismount round-trips against a test container; change-password and benchmark work; every user-facing string is English + Cantonese; all file/folder selection uses `FileDialogs` (no WinRT pickers); no "Hui/VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt" branding visible.
